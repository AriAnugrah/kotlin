its all about kotlin. as for now there only 1 project name basic kotlin, with 3 package



##### kotlin basic

all basic kotlin programming list,array, selection, interface

##### calculator interface

example program calculator using interface class, and console as menu

##### fizzbuzz

example program of odd and even for, use console as menu



important to mention, almost all file in this project have main function, meaning you need to make sure which one you run. 



another importan thing, because all file in same project, be carefull when you name varibal or function. theres posibility duplicate name in function/variable. one error in one file, meaning you cant run other main function
